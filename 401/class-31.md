it is used to create Android UI tests.

 Espresso tests state expectations, interactions, and assertions clearly without the distraction of boilerplate content, custom infrastructure, or messy implementation details

 ## Note:

 - Espresso tests run optimally fast 
 - it used for  automated testing 
 -  it can be used for black-box testing
 - more reliable and dependable testing 



 ## Synchronization capabilities

 when you create a test and you invoke onView(), 
 Espresso performs the following actions:
- The message queue is empty.
- There are no instances of AsyncTask currently executing a task.
- All developer-defined idling resources are idle.

this increase the possibility of only one UI action or assertion can occur at any given time



## Packages


- espresso-core 
- espresso-web 
- espresso-idling-resource 
- espresso-contrib 
- espresso-intents
- espresso-remote


## Espresso Test Recorder 

it's a tool lets you create UI tests for your app without writing any test code. 

you will need to: 
1. record your interactions with a device 
2. add assertions to verify UI elements in particular snapshots of your app 
3. the Espresso Test Recorder then takes the saved recording and automatically generates a corresponding UI test that you can run to test your app.



## Notes:
- the Espresso Test Recorder writes tests based on the Espresso Testing framework, an API in AndroidX Test. 

- you will need to make sure you turn off animations on your test device to prevent unexpected results. 

-  you do not need to manually set a dependency reference to the Espresso library because Test Recorder does this automatically when you save a recording. 


## Record an Espresso test 

Espresso tests consist of:

1. UI interactions 
 `tap` and `type` actions that are used to  interact with your app

2. assertions on View elements 
 verifies the existence or contents of visual elements on the screen.

 assertion types:
 -  text is: Checks the text content of the selected View element

- exists: Checks that the View element is present in the current View hierarchy visible on the screen

- does not exist: Checks that the View element is not present in the current View hierarchy


 **`Record UI interactions`**

steps of recording a test with Espresso Test Recorder:

`step one: `
- Click Run > Record Espresso Test.

- In the Select Deployment Target window, choose the device on which you want to record the test. If necessary, create a new Android Virtual Device. Click OK.

- Espresso Test Recorder triggers a build of your project, and the app must install and launch before Espresso Test Recorder allows you to interact with it. The Record Your Test window appears after the app launches, and since you have not interacted with the device yet, the main panel reads "No events recorded yet." Interact with your device to start logging events such as "tap" and "type" actions.

- you will see the recorded interactions in the main panel in the Record Your Test window

`step two:`
Add assertions to verify UI elements 


-  Click Add Assertion. 

- click on the element in the screenshot or use the first drop-down menu in the Edit assertion box 

- Select an assertion  to use from the  the Edit assertion box.

- Save and Add Another  

`step three:`

Save a recording 

- Click Complete Recording 
- Use the Test class name text field if you want to change the suggested name.
- Click Save.

Note: Where the test saves depends on the location of your instrumentation test root, as well as the package name of the launched activity

`step four`:

Run an Espresso test locally

-  use the Project window on the left side of the Android Studio IDE:

1. Open the desired app module folder and navigate to the test you want to run. 
2. Right-click on the test and click Run â€˜testName. 
3. Select Deployment Target window, choose the device on which you want to run the test.

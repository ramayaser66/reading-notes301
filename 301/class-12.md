#  EJS PARTIALS

____________________________________

when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views you us  **partials**

>EJS partials work like EJS layouts too in creating a single fix content on a web page.

**why use partials**
-   they make large websites easier to maintain

you define that reusable bundle of code in a file andinclude it wherever you need it.

creating and including partials is very straightforward with EJS.

- help us to avoid repetition of the same code on several web pages.

 **For example**, you may want the same header for several web pages. EJS partials work like EJS layouts too in creating a single fix content on a web page. 

 -  useful for reusing the same markup between different views, layouts, and even other partials.

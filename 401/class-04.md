# Object-Oriented 

- Object 
they consist of state and behavior.
the state of an object is represented in variables and the behavior in methods AKA functions.


the term data encapsulation is considered a fundamental principle of  object-oriented programming which is when you hide the state of an object and all the interactions are through a method. 

advantages of using individual objects:
1. modularity 
2. information hiding
3. reuse the code 
4.  the ability to Plug and debug

- Class 
 A Class is like an object constructor or a blueprint that your objects is based on. 

Note:  The responsibility of creating and using new objects belongs to some class in the application.


- Inheritance 
Objects can have some similar data so  classes are able to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes. 

you will have  the superclass
and each superclass has the potential for an unlimited number of subclasses


- Package 
 a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner 

 Advantages:
   makes the projects easier to manage.

   API class library("Application Programming Interface")

   Its packages represent the tasks most commonly associated with general-purpose programming.

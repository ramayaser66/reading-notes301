 ### the installation party 
 
 *what we did for the second part of our course is that  we focused on installing some programs that will be our main* *concern like the* 
*Command line interface (terminal)*
 *and Visual studio code. we also focused on Setting up WSL Version 2 and the Ubuntu app and it was a very long process* 
 *these programs require certain tools that had to be installed like Homebrew,gcc,Node & NPM, Git, live-server, Tree and* 
*ESLin.this process involved a lot of complicated codes that later was checked and inspected for its latest version and*
*that it its runnung correctly.*

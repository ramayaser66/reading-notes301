Operators and loops 

-	Conditional statements 
A conditional statement is based on a concept of ( if /then/else if )
If a condition is met then you code is executed if not the else part is executed 
A conditional statement consists of:

 if ( the condition) { if the condition is correct} else { if the condition is incorrect }

## Loops!

![loops](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javascript/images/for_loop.jpg)

Loops tests the condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. 
Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again.  It repeats until the condition returns false. 
Types of loops 
-	For 
-	While 
-	Do while 

For loop, is used when you need to run the code a specific numbers of times, in this loop the condition is usually a counter which tell you how many time the loop should run. 

While loop, the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is true. So it is used for when you donâ€™t know how many time the code should run or for when you want a specific input so it keeps running until the user inputs the command that turns it to false. <br>

## Normalization:
the process of organizing data in a database. This includes:
- creating tables

- establishing relationships between those tables according to rules designed both to protect the data

- to make the database more flexible by eliminating redundancy and inconsistent dependency


## First normal form

- Eliminate repeating groups in individual tables.
- Create a separate table for each set of related data.
- Identify each set of related data with a primary key.


## Second normal form

- Create separate tables for sets of values that apply to multiple records.
- Relate these tables with a foreign key

## Third normal form

Eliminate fields that do not depend on the key.

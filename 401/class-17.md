spring security provides comprehensive security services for j2ee-based enterprise software applications. it is powerful, flexible, and pluggable. 

oauth is an open-authorization protocol that allows accessing resources of the resource owner by enabling the client applications on http services, such as gmail, github, etc.


- `OAuth2` is an authorization framework that enables the application Web Security to access the resources from the client. To build an OAuth2 application, we need to focus on the Grant Type (Authorization code), Client ID and Client secret.

## roles that can be applied on oauth2:

1. resource owner: the owner of the resource — this is pretty self-explanatory.
2. resource server: this serves resources that are protected by the oauth2 token.
3. client: the application accessing the resource server.
4. authorization server: this is the server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.


- oauth2 tokens: tokens are implementation specific random strings, generated by the authorization server.

- access token: sent with each request, usually valid for about an hour only.
refresh token: it is used to get a 00new access token, not sent with each request, usually lives longer than access token.

to build a sample app doing various things with "social login" using OAuth 2.0 and Spring Boot

Note: The samples are all single-page apps using Spring Boot and Spring Security on the back end. 

dding new features at each step:

- simple: a very basic static app with just a home page and unconditional login via Spring Boot’s OAuth 2.0 configuration properties (if you visit the home page, you will be automatically redirected to GitHub).

- click: adds an explicit link that the user has to click to login.

- logout: adds a logout link as well for authenticated users.

- two-providers: adds a second login provider so the user can choose on the home page which one to use.

- custom-error: adds an error message for unauthenticated users, and a custom authentication based on GitHub’s API.

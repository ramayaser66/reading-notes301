## Js commands 
 <pre><code>    
&lt;script&gt; &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
 ____________________________

# Variables 
Js has something called variables which act as containers to certain values like:
Numbers 
-	<pre> <code>var  name of the variable = value; 
The value could be a number, strings and something called Booleans

## How computers work

<br>


What is the story behind virtual reality 
How do computers really work and what makes a computer a computer 
How the information is presented and inputted to the webs and computers 
Its design and the math behind it 
The tools we build to solve problem, and what you need to actually have a functioning computer 
Like, 	
-	Input 
-	Storage 
-	Processing 
-	Output

The progress we through time until we’re finally here in the twenty first century 
Using computer in varies fields in life thinking we started with only 0 and 1.
Using the binary system you represent any type of system 
Numbers 
Words 
Letters 
Photos & videos which at the end are represented by 0 and 1 

Circuits and how to use them in making your ideas come to life 
Using millions of tiny electronics electronic components that can modify and process information that are represented by 1& 0, using electronic signals 
A combination of electronic signals can represent varies signals 
 For example 
-	And 
-	NAND
-	NOT 
-	NOR
-	XOR  

Connecting these circuits together will result a more complicated circuits 
Which will do a more complex calculations 
The cup, memory how to handle inputs and output 
The software and hardware behind all this.

 a database computer language designed for the retrieval and management of data in a relational database. 






 a language that is designed to allow technical and non-technical users to:

 ## Relational databases

  A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.



## SQL applications 

As mentioned before, SQL is one of the most widely used query language over the databases. I'm going to list few of them here:

Allows users to access data in the relational database management systems.

Allows users to describe the data.

Allows users to define the data in a database and manipulate that data.

Allows to embed within other languages using SQL modules, libraries & pre-compilers.

Allows users to create and drop databases and tables.

Allows users to create view, stored procedure, functions in a database.

Allows users to set permissions on tables, procedures and views.

# Javascript Templating

![jjj](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTBh9z9sfJ-EOktSaaDmREUcxtBt7aJnEcaXw&usqp=CAU)

 a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. The template engine then replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime, and convert the template into an HTML file sent to the client.

# Mustache
 a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code.
It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

Note: mustache.js is an implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript. It is often considered the base for JavaScript templating.
[Mustache.render(“Hello, {{name}}”, { name: “Sherlynn” });
// returns: Hello, Sherlynn]

 Mustache syntax to show that it is a placeholder.

Display:

This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.

-	flex-direction

•	row (default): left to right in ltr; right to left in rtl
•	row-reverse: right to left in ltr; left to right in rtl
•	column: same as row but top to bottom
•	column-reverse: same as row-reverse but bottom to top


-	flex-wrap

By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line.
To change that:
•	nowrap (default): all flex items will be on one line
•	wrap: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom.
•	wrap-reverse: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from bottom to top.


-	flex-flow
a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties, which together define the flex container’s main and cross axes. The default value is row nowrap.

-	justify-content:
1.	flex start 
2.	flex-end
3.	center 
4.	space-between
5.	space-around
6.	space-evenly 

 and many others.

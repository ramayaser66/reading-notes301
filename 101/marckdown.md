## Markdown 


*Like HTML it's a markup language but not a programming language ( it doesn't use tags and doesn't do functions ). 
It is light weighted language, easy control and faster to use. 
It requires tools like Visual studio, command terminal and even Notepad.* 

It has a lot of features ( some of which I already applied in this read-note ).
for example:

- Quoting text
using (: or >)
- Italic text
using (* *  or_ )
- Headings
using 
(#text or ## text or ###text)
- Strikethrough 
using (~~ ~~ )
- lists 
using ( - or *) 
 and many others

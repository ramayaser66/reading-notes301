   HTML uses Tags like html, head, body, h1 and many others in <>
   - the head tag is used to tell information about the page.
   - the body tag is for the main content of your web page.
   - the meta tag is to describe the page but it won't show for the user, it's only for searching the page on the internet.
   - t create lists you can use the ordered list (ol) or the unordered list (ul) and use with them the li tag.
   - you can add images using img scr="" inside <>
   - there are section and article tags and they are used to help order the paragraphs.

   many other tags are used, these are just a small sample from todays class

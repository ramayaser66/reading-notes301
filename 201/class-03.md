<br> 

-	 *Numbered lists ( Ordered lists ).*
                       *The ordered list is created *with the  ol element.*
                *Each item in the list is placed* *between an opening li tag and a* *closing li*
-	*Bullet lists ( Unordered lists ).*
        *The ordered list is created with the  ul* *element.*
                *Each item in the list is placed* *between an opening li tag and a* *closing li*


-	*Definition lists ( Definition lists ).*
*The definition list is created with the dl element *and usually consists of a series of terms and their *definitions.
*Inside the dl element you will usually see pairs of *dt and dd elements.
*dt ,  This is used to contain the term being defined*(the definition term).* 
*dd , This is used to contain the definition.*

##  Nested Lists 

You can put a second list inside an ‘<li>’ element to create a sub list or nested list. 


	# boxes 
 	  CSS treats each HTML element as if it lives in its own box. You can set several properties that affect the appearance of these boxes. You can Control their dimensions, Create borders around them, Set margins and padding and Show and hide boxes. 
## Box Dimensions 
By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties. The most popular ways to specify the size of a box are to use pixels, percentages, or ems. Traditionally, pixels have been the most popular method because they allow designers to accurately control their size.
-	When you use percentages, the size of the box is relative to the size of the browser window or, if the box is encased within another box, it is a percentage of the size of the containing box.

-	When you use ems, the size of the box is based on the size of text within it. Designers have recently started to use percentages and ems more for measurements as they try to create designs that are flexible across devices which have different-sized screens

## Limiting Width
( min-width, max-width )
Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's screen. In such designs, the min-width property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow, and the max-width property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide. 
These are very helpful properties to ensure that the content of pages are legible (especially on the smaller screens of handheld devices). For example, you can use the max-width property to ensure that lines of text do not appear too wide within a big browser window and you can use the min-width property to make sure that they do not appear too narrow. 

##  Limiting Height 
( min-height, max-height )

In the same way that you might want to limit the width of a box on a page, you may also want to limit the height of it. This is achieved using the min-height and max-height properties.

## Overflowing Content 
(overflow) 
The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself . It can have one of two values:
-	Hidden, this property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.


-	 Scroll, This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.

The overflow property is particularly handy because some browsers allow users to adjust the size of the text to appear as large or as small as they want. If the text is set too large then the page can become an unreadable mess. Hiding the overflow on such boxes helps prevent items overlapping on the page.

##  Border, Margin & Padding

Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance: 
1.	Border 

Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another. 

2.	Margin 
  	Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes. 

3.	Padding 
Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents. 
And many other like:  border style , width, color, shorthand, padding, margin, center content, Change Inline/Block, Hiding Boxes ...

## Basic JavaScript Instructions 	
-	ARRAYS
 An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.  
Arrays are especially helpful when you do not know how many items a list will contain because, when you create the array, you do not need to specify how many values it will hold.  
## CREATING AN ARRAY 
You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable (using the var keyword followed by the name of the array) 
-	array literal 
The values are assigned to the array inside a pair of square brackets, and each value is separated by a comma. The values in the array do not need to be the same data type, so you can store a string, a number and a Boolean all in the same array.   
‘colors= ['white', 
'black',
 'custom'];’ 

## VALU ES IN ARRAYS 
-	NUMBERING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY
-	ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY 
-	NUMBER OF ITEMS IN AN ARRAY



# Decisions and loops

![loops](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/php/images/decision_making.jpg)

1.	USING IF ... ELSE 
if ... e 1 se statement allows you to provide two sets of code:
 - One set if the condition evaluates to true.
-  Another set if the condition is false.

2.	 SWITCH STATEMENTS 
A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value. The entire statement lives in one code block (set of curly braces), and a colon separates the option from the statements that are to be run if the case matches the switch value.

## TYPE COERCION & WEAK TYPING
 If you use a data type JavaScript did not expect, it tries to make sense of the operation rather than report an error. JavaScript can convert data types behind the scenes to complete an operation. This is known as type coercion. For example, a string 'l ' could be converted to a number 1 in the following expression: (' 1' > 0). As a result, the above expression would evaluate to true.   

## TRUTHY & FALSY VALUES
  
 Due to type coercion, every value in JavaScript can be treated as if it were true or false; and this has some interesting side effects. 

## CHECKING EQUALITY & EXISTENCE 
Because the presence of an object or array can be considered truthy, it is often used to check for the existence of an element within a page. 

##  KEY LOOP CONCEPTS 
-	Break This keyword causes the termination of the loop and tells the interpreter to go onto the next statement of code outside of the loop. (You may also see it used in functions.) 

-	 Continue this keyword tells the interpreter to continue with the current iteration, and then check the condition again. (If it is true, the code runs again.) 

-	LOOPS & ARRAYS Loops are very helpful when dealing with arrays if you want to run the same code for each item in the array.

RegEex features
once you’ve learned the syntax, you can actually use this tool in (almost) all programming languages 

 topics: 
-	Anchors — ^ and $
-	Quantifiers — * + ? and {}

-	OR operator — | or []

-	Character classes — \d \w \s and .

Note:
A regex usually comes within this form /abc/, where the search pattern is delimited by two slash characters /. At the end we can specify a flag with these values (we can also combine them each other)




## Intermediate topics:

-	Grouping and capturing — ()
-	Bracket expressions — []
-	Greedy and Lazy match


## Advanced topics:
-	Boundaries — \b and \B

-	Back-references — \1
-	Look-ahead and Look-behind — (?=) and (?<=)

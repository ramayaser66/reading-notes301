 # >TEXT 
 

> NOTE: tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.

To add markup to the text that appears on your pages you’ll need:
-	add markup to the text that appears on your pages

-	 Semantic markup: which provides extra information.

For example:

## Headings 

![headings](https://res.cloudinary.com/weboptimizers/image/upload/v1529106771/HTML-Headings_a1lgjh.png)
<br>


-	 ‘h1’  ,  is used for main headings. 
-	‘h2’ ,  is used for subheadings.

-	If there are further sections under the subheadings then the’h3’ element is used, and so on.

## Paragraphs

<br>

 *To create a paragraph, surround the words that make* *up the paragraph with an opening ‘< p>’ tag and*
 *closing ‘</p>* 
*By default, a browser will show each paragraph on a* *new line with some space between it and any* *subsequent paragraphs.*  






-	HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

-	They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).


# INTRODUCING CSS 
-	CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look. 

-	 Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).

-	Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.

-	 Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value Arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

# JavaScript
  > Basic JavaScript Instructions 
-  A script is made up of a series of statements. 
 -  Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
- Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
- Expressions evaluate into a single value.
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

## 	Decisions and loops 

![loops](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/php/images/decision_making.jpg)
<br> 


*Helps us create and control the flow of data in your* *scripts to handle different situations.*

-	Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
-	Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, , <=, =>) are used to compare two operands
-	Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.

-	if ... else statements allow you to run one set t of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.

## Cascading style sheet.

Css is responsible for the presentation of the presentation of your web page, how ot looks and how to design it! 
Css has a bunch of rules that will allow you to specify how the content of an element should appear, for example: the layout, the background, the font color and many others.
These changes will appear on your HTML webpage and you’ll see that there are more than one way to apply those rules:

-	In style line 
To do that you need to add style attributes like < h1 style=””></h1>
-	Style section
Create a separate style section to write your commands 
-	Create a style sheet with the extension .css and then link it to your HTML page 


 ##The Css command will contain 
A selector {a property:  value} and a rule.

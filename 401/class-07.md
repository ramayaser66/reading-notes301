_________________________________________________________________________


- Single responsibility principle(SRP):
a class is required to only do one job. 
in other words the class or module should have only one reason to change.


- Open closed principle:
The class can be extended to other classes but without it being modified or have things added to it.



- Liskov substitution principle:
 every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

- Interface segregation principle:
you shouldn't have have to implement an interface if it's not gonna be used. 


- Dependency inversion.
Depend on abstraction, not on concretions. 
the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.

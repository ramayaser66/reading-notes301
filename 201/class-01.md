## HTML
<p> is used to create web pages. you start by writing down the words you want to appear on your page. You then add tags or elements to the words so that the browser knows what is a heading, where a paragraph begins and ends, and so on. There’s what is known as tags you have at your disposal to create web pages, for example: text, lists, links, images, tables, forms, video audio and flash, and miscellaneous elements.</p>

## CSS 
<p> *uses rules to enable you to control the styling and layout of web pages. The wide variety of CSS properties you can use in your CSS rules. These properties generally fall into one of two categories: 
-	Presentation: 
How to control things like the color of text, the fonts you want to use and the size of those fonts, how to add background colors to pages (or parts of a page), and how to add background images.

-	Layout:
 How to control where the different elements are positioned on the screen. You will also learn several techniques that professionals use to make their pages more attractive.* </p>



#  HTML Structure


<p> 
HTML Describes the Structure of Pages
The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets — these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it. Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.</p>

*Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.* 

 *Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.*
The body element: 
 Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.
_______________________________________________________________________

The head element: 
Before the body element you will often see a head element. This contains information about the page (rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser window)


The title element:
The contents of the title element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that page (if your browser uses tabs to allow you to view multiple pages at the same time).
And so many other structure elements ! 

# EXTRA Markup 
-	X DOCTYPES 
Tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.

  # HTML5 Layout 

- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
             -   The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple div elements).
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.




# Process and design 
 
-	It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
-	Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
-	Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
-	] Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
-	You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
-	You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

## The ABC of programming 

1.	A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.

2.	Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.


3.	Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically.

4.	To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

# what google learned from its quest to build the perfect team 
## Work groups 
<br>




<br>

Whatever field you in. you are bound to face a situation where you find yourself in a work group.
Work groups differs from one another. And people have different ways of handling and dealing with other people in their work groups. And each prefer a different type of people and different way of dealing with things. Some people prefer strict and ordered group types that have a set of ground rules that they follow and where the work and authority are divided between them. And it is strictly work between them and no side chats or unrelated subjects. 
Others may like the exact opposite were all the work is shared between them without any strict rules or the authority being divided or being in one personâ€™s hand. They all collaborate with brane storming and different ideas in a safe place where no idea is a bad idea. The work has its own time and any extra time left there is room for small talks and getting to know one another so you can feel secure enough around them.

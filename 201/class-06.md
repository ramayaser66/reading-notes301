 > #  Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming

### Hardest things about writing codes?
## some might say: 
•	For example: Learning a new technology
•	Naming things
•	Testing your code
•	Debugging
•	Fixing bugs
•	Making software maintainable

> # Object literals 

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

-	IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES
-	IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS
## Creating an Object: Literal Notation
Literal Notation is a way to create objects it is basically an array of key: value pairs, with a colon separating the keys and values, and a comma after every key: value pair, except for the last, just like a regular array. Values created with anonymous functions are methods of your object. Simple values are properties.
## Accessing object and dot notation 

-	We use dot notation 
The name of the object followed by a period, then the name of the property or method you want to access. 
-	Using square brackets 
You can access the property of an object (but not its methods) using square brackets syntax 

# Document Object Model 
(DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 
The DOM is neither part of HTML, nor part of JavaScript; it is a separate set of rules. It is implemented by all major browser makers, and covers two primary areas: 

-	## MAKING A MODEL OF THE HTM L PAGE
 When the browser loads a web page, it creates a model of the page in memory. The DOM specifies the way in which the browser should structure this model using a DOM tree. The DOM is called an object model because the model (the DOM tree) is made of objects. Each object represents a different part of the page loaded in the browser window.

-	## ACCESSING AND CHANGING THE HTML PAGE
The DOM also defines methods and properties to access and update each object in this model, which in turn updates what the user sees in the browser.

__________________________________________________ 


-	The browser represents the page using a DOM tree.
-	 DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.
-	 You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.
-	 Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will always return a Nadel i st.
-	 From an element node, you can access and update its content using properties such as textContent and i nnerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques. 
-	An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other.
-	In older - browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery). 
-	Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree.

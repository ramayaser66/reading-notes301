# Linked Lists

 a sequence of
 individual items that are in the linked list these items are called nodes, each node contains the data for each link and they are connected to one another, where each Node references the next Node in the link.

 > Notes: 
 - nodes gave a property called `Next` which contains the r
 reference to the next node. 
 - the first reference in a linked list is called a `Head`. 
 - the node that you are at is called a `Current`.


 make sure to you create a new Current variable at the Head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list when traversing. 

 in traversing, loops like `for` and `for each`  are not used, instead use `while loops` the Next property is responsible for getting the next value in the node AKA next reference which we extract the data from. 

 ## types of linked lists:

 1.  Singly.

 ____________________________________________________

 - it indicates the number of references the node has, 
 -  in this type there is only one reference 
 - the reference is for the next node in the linked list 


 2. Doubly.

 ## type of data structure:

 1. linear data structures
 there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed

 2. non-linear data structures
  items donâ€™t have to be arranged in order, 
   we could traverse the data structure non-sequentially.

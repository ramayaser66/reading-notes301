How to use JavaScript in web browsers, make interactions with the users and a lot more interesting!
How to add JavaScript orders on an html and how to link it properly. JavaScript allows you to, 

- Access content 
- modify content 
- Program rules 
- react to events 
---------------------------

## Writing a script

 Scripts you  read or write will be very complicated and might look intimidating but a script is just a series of short instructions, each of which is performed in order to solve the problem in hand. So a program must give the computer enough detail to perform. 
 A quick way to organize your work:

-	 DEFINE THE GOAL 
-	define the task you want to achieve 
-	 CODE EACH STEP 

A series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this problem,
Write down individual steps that the computer needs to perform in order to complete each individual task (and any information it needs to perform the task)

 ### Variables and assigning a value to them
Variable name = value;

JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values known as Booleans.

-NUMERIC DATA TYPE 
-STRING DATA TYPE
-BOOLEAN DATA TYPE

Note: Once you have assigned a value to a variable, you can then change what is stored in the variable later in the same script. Once the variable has been created, you do not need to use the var keyword to assign it a new value. You just use the variable name, the equals sign (also known as the assignment operator), and the new value for that attribute.


Functions 
Function name() { code block }
 Functions are something you use to help with the codes 
You can reuse these function any time you want instead of writing the same code over and over 
You just call the function when needed will save time and make your code more readable.

You call a function by function name();
